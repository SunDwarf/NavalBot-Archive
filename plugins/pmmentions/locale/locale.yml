help.pmmentions: |
      Messages you when you are mentioned.

      There are three possible options:
        - `on` -> Message you on every mention.
        - `away` -> Only message you if you're away or offline.
        - `off` (default) -> Do not message you.

      You can check your current status by running the command without an argument.

pmmentions.status: ":heavy_check_mark: Your pmmentions status is now `{status}`."
pmmentions.unknown: ":x: Unknown option."
