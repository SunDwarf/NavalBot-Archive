# This is the localization database for NavalBot.
# This is used to localize messages.
#
# locale.yml is the default file, where keys are loaded from if they do not exist
# locale.<lang>.yml is used for loading locale from language-specific files.
#
# When localizing a file, DO NOT REPLACE ANYTHING INSIDE { } OR ANYTHING INSIDE :_:.
# These are used by the bot to build up the strings automatically.
# You can re-order them for the sentences to make sense, but they must stay in the sentence.

        Please note that admins can still unlock and edit the factoids even when locked.

        This takes an optional second parameter: the number of which to start. The command will output the queue from that position onwards.

help.skip: |
        Skips tracks.

        This takes an optional second parameter: the number of tracks to skip.
        This will skip the current track, then <num - 1> tracks in the queue.

help.voteskip: |
        Starts a vote to skip the currently playing track.
